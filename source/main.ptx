        <title>The Axioms of Probability</title>
        <p>
          Intuition can mislead us, particularly in probability, so we make an effort 
          to be careful from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's motivate the definition and consider an example or two before we give it
          precisely.
          To describe an experiment or trial with random outcomes, we need three things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              A <em>sample space</em> <m>\Omega</m>, the set of all possible <em>outcomes</em>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A family <m>\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^{\Omega}</m> of permissible <em>events</em>.
              (It is less obvious that we need this.)
              By <m>2^\Omega</m> we mean the powerset of <m>\Omega</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              An assignment <m>P</m> of probabilities (numbers) to events.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <example>
        <statement>
        <p>Toss a fair coin 3 times. What is the probability that you see exactly two heads?</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            What are the possible outcomes of this experiment?
          <me>
            \Omega = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTH, THT, HTT, TTT \}
          </me>
          to be finished
        </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <example>
        <statement>
          <p>
            My neighbor and I each leave home, independently, between 8 and 9am,
            where any time is equally likely. What is the probability that she leaves
            at least 20 minutes before I do?

                Roll two fair 6-sided dice.

                The events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are certainly independent:

                That <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent is explained in the statement of the example.

              <p>
                There are many ways to count full houses, but the simplest is probably to choose the 
                two ranks first, first the rank of the triplet and then the rank of the pair.
                There are 13 ways of choosing the rank A of the triplet, leaving 12 possibilities for the
                rank B of the pair. Then there are <m>\binom{4}{3}</m> possible triplets of cards of rank
                A and <m>\binom{4}{2}</m> possible pairs of cards of rank B. We can now compute the total
                probability:
                <me>
                  \frac{13 \cdot 12 \cdot \binom{4}{3} \binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{5}}
                  = \frac{13 \cdot 12 \cdot 4 \cdot 6}{\binom{52}{5}}
                  \approx 0.0014
                </me>
              </p>
              <p>
                Two pairs: again, it is probably simplest to choose the ranks A, B, and C
                first. But here we have an overcounting problem, since there is symmetry in A
                and B. So there are <m>13\cdot 12 \cdot 11 / 2</m> many ways of choosing the three ranks
                A, B, and C, where the division by 2 represents the fact that 
                22JJA and JJ22A give the same choice.
                Once we have chosen the three ranks, we have <m>\binom42 \binom 42 \binom 41</m> many
                ways to choose cards of these ranks, so this is our total:
                <me>
                  \frac{ \frac{13\cdot 12 \cdot 11}{2} \cdot \binom42 \binom 42 \binom 41}{\binom{52}{5}}
                  \approx 0.0475.

            <title>Birthdays</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                There are 28 students in the class. What is the probability that two of you chosen at random
                share a birthday?
              </p>
              <p>
                (You may make the simplifying assumptions that leap years don't exist 
                and that birthdays are uniformly distributed.)
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                There are <m>365^{28}</m> possible outcomes, each of which is equally likely.
                This is a good example where <q>counting the complement</q> works well.
                That is, instead of counting the event we are asked to count, we will count its
                complement, the event that no two students share a birthday.
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of ways of assigning 28 distinct birthdays to 28 students is
                <m>\binom{365}{28} 28!</m>, the number of ways of choosing which 28 birthdays
                will be represented times the number of ways of assigning them to everyone in order.
                It may help to record another way of expressing this quantity:
                <me>
                  \binom{365}{28} 28! = 365 \cdot 364 \cdot \cdots \cdot 338.
                </me>
                Now we can simplify the probability that no two people share a birthday:
                <me>
                  P(\text{no birthday shared}) = \frac{\binom{365}{28} 28!}{365^{28}}
                  = \frac{365!}{337!} \cdot \frac{1}{365^{28}}.
                </me>
                A computer reports that this quantity is <m>\approx 0.3455</m>.
                So the probability that at least two people share a birthday is about <m>65\%</m>.

            <title>Matching hats</title>
            <statement>
              <p>
                Each of <m>n</m> people is wearing a hat that they toss into a pile.
                Then each person retrieves a hat at random. What is the probability that at least one
                person gets their hat back?
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                Let <m>A_i</m> denote the event that the <m>i</m>th person gets their hat back.
                We want to compute <m>P(\bigcup_{1\le i \le n} A_i)</m>.
                Recall the Inclusion<ndash/>Exclusion Principle:
                <men xml:id="men-incl-excl">
                  P\left( \bigcup_{1\le i \le n} A_i \right)
                  = \sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i) - \sum_{i \lt j} P(A_i \cap A_j) + \sum_{i \lt j \lt k} P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k)
                    + \cdots + (-1)^{n+1} P(A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n)
                </men>
                Now <m>P(A_i) = \frac{1}{n}</m>; what about <m>P(A_i \cap A_j)</m>?
                Conditional probability gives us a nice way of thinking about this:
                <me>
                  P(A_i \cap A_j) = P(A_j) P(A_i | A_j) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{(n-1)} = \frac{(n-2)!}{n!}.  
                </me>
                (Why? The probability that <m>i</m> gets their hat back given that <m>j</m> does is 
                <m>\frac{1}{n-1}</m>.)
                A similar argument shows that <m>P(A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k) = \frac{(n-3)!}{n!}</m>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now we are in a position to simplify the expression in <xref ref="men-incl-excl"/>:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \amp = n \cdot \frac{1}{n} - \frac{(n-2)!}{n!} \binom{n}{2} + \frac{(n-3)!}{n!} \binom{n}{3} + \cdots </mrow>
                  <mrow> \amp = 1 - \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} - \cdots + \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n!}</mrow>
                </md>
                What we're really interested in is the behavior of this quantity as <m>n \to \infty</m>.
                Remembering a little calculus, we see that this probability converges to <m>1 - e^{-1} \approx 0.63</m>.

        <p>
          Informally, a <term>random variable</term> is a random number 
          whose value is associated with the various outcome of an experiment.
        </p>
        <example>
          <p>
            Toss a fair coin three coins, so that the sample space <m>\Omega</m>
            includes outcomes like HHH, TTH, etc.
            One example of a random variable associated to this experiment is 
            simply the number <m>X</m> of heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a more sophisticated random variable.
            Suppose that we start with $1, double our money if we see heads
            and lose it all if we see tails.
            Then <m>W</m> could be our winnings after this experiment.
            (Notice that <m>W = 8</m> if we see HHH and <m>=0</m> otherwise.)
          </p>
        </example>
        <example>
          <p>
            Suppose that my neighbor and I each leave home independently between
            8 and 9am, each time equally likely, so <m>\Omega = [8,9]\times[8,9]</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            One random variable is the time I leave: <m>(x,y) \mapsto x</m>.
            Another is the time between our departures: <m>(x,y) \mapsto |x - y|</m>.
          </p>
        </example>
        <p>
          Now we are ready for the formal definition.
          Suppose that <m>(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)</m> is a probability space.

                It is useful to notice that, for fixed <m>x\in\R</m>,
                <m>\{X = x\} = \bigcup_y \{X = x \text{ and } Y = y\}</m>,
                and that this is a disjoint union.
                Thus, by the additivity of the probability measure,
                <m>P(X = x) = \sum_y P(X = x \text{ and } Y = y)</m>.
                We will use this fact and a similar one with the roles of 
                <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> interchanged in what follows.

                Combining all this, we get:

                To show that <m>X+Y</m> and <m>\abs{X-Y}</m> are dependent,

                and <m>\{\abs{X-Y} = 0\}</m> are dependent.
                But of course! The only way for <m>X+Y</m> to equal <m>0</m>
                is for <m>X = Y = 0</m>, and this implies that <m>\abs{X-Y} = 0</m>.
                In other words, <m>P(X+Y = 0 \text{ and } \abs{X-Y} = 0) =

                  E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) = \tfrac12 + \tfrac12 = 1.

                  E(\abs{X-Y}(X+Y)) = 0P(Z = 0) + 1P(Z = 1) + 2P(Z = 2)

                And <m>\tfrac12 \cdot 1 = \tfrac12</m>, so <m>X+Y</m> and <m>\abs{X-Y}</m>

                  \var(aX) = E((aX - E(aX)^2))

              </p>
              <p>
                The second part follows from our other characterization of variance:

                  <mrow> \var(X+Y) \amp = E((X+Y)^2) - (E(X+Y))^2 </mrow>
