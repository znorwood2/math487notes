<div class="para">There are many ways to count full houses, but the simplest is probably to choose the two ranks first, first the rank of the triplet and then the rank of the pair. There are 13 ways of choosing the rank A of the triplet, leaving 12 possibilities for the rank B of the pair. Then there are <span class="process-math">\(\binom{4}{3}\)</span> possible triplets of cards of rank A and <span class="process-math">\(\binom{4}{2}\)</span> possible pairs of cards of rank B. We can now compute the total probability:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{13 \cdot 12 \cdot \binom{4}{3} \binom{4}{2}}{\binom{52}{5}}
= \frac{13 \cdot 12 \cdot 4 \cdot 6}{\binom{52}{5}}
\approx 0.0014
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Two pairs: again, it is probably simplest to choose the ranks A, B, and C first. But here we have an overcounting problem, since there is symmetry in A and B. So there are <span class="process-math">\(13\cdot 12 \cdot 11 / 2\)</span> many ways of choosing the three ranks A, B, and C, where the division by 2 represents the fact that 22JJA and JJ22A give the same choice. Once we have chosen the three ranks, we have <span class="process-math">\(\binom42 \binom 42 \binom 41\)</span> many ways to choose cards of these ranks, so this is our total:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{ \frac{13\cdot 12 \cdot 11}{2} \cdot \binom42 \binom 42 \binom 41}{\binom{52}{5}}
\approx 0.0475.
